# hello-world
explore a brand new world
I am a newer in this digital world. This is fun and scard at the same time, so far so good. I have tried some command line on my Mac. I feel very excited about I can ask my Mac to do something without using the interface. Also I tried some command which didn't work, luckily I figure out why and when it works or doesn't. Exciting and a little bit scard in a strange world!
